Repository where I dump code related to trading algorithms and such. Wouldn't recommend using for any actual investments, not financial advice etc. References are included at the end of the README.md

## FastSMA_SlowSMA.py:
This code makes use of a simple moving average algorithm to determine if a trade should be made or not, making use of the Binance API. The example plot can be seen in the examples folder [1]
